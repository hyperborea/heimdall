# Heimdall

Heimdall is a free and open-source data visualization and business monitoring system. It's meant to run on-premise within your company network and leverages your existing databases. Collaboration is at its core, so everything you do can be shared and co-owned, changes are pushed in realtime to users.

## Core concepts

- **Sources** are configured database connections
- **Jobs** run and cache queries on a _source_ and can be scheduled, have alarms and notification
- **Visualizations** represent _job_ results through a variety of possible widgets
- **Dashboards** organize multiple _visualizations_

## Features

- a variety of visualization widgets including
  - line, bar and area charts that can be stacked and combined
  - sortable tables with configurable column types
  - "big number" widgets
  - calendar heatmaps
  - geo maps
  - world and US maps
  - progress widgets
  - pie and donut charts
- interactive dashboards through query parameterization
- supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, CSV and JSON
- queries can be scheduled to run periodically or are executed automatically after the cache validity expires
- alarms and easy rule system supporting notification through email and Slack
- authentication through passwords, LDAP, Google, Github and / or Facebook
- permission management through groups for sources, jobs and dashboards
- realtime updates of configuration and dashboards
